*** QUICK START GUIDE:

  This is not the Oracle::OCI module! This is a chunk of code that writes
  the Oracle::OCI module dynamically by reading the Oracle header files!

  This is very much an experimental alpha work-in-progress,
  but it works for me and the connect.t script connects just fine.

  You'll need perl 5.6, C::Scan 0.74 and, if you want to help,
  a willingness to dig in get your hands dirty in code.

  Run the 'boot' perl script.  It'll write the Oracle::OCI extension
  into an Oracle/OCI subdirectory, build it and test it for you. You
  may need to edit the connect.t script to refer to a local Oracle
  instance and username and password. It defaults to SID=ORCL and the
  Oracle demo user: scott/tiger.

  (Ignore the Makefile.PL for this release.)


*** IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS:

Please fix them and send me the fix!


*** HOW TO REPORT PROGRESS:
